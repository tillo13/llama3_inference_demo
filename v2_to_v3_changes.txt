
Changes Made to the Script
Increased Epochs:

Updated num_train_epochs in TrainingArguments from 1 to 2.
Model Preparation Order:

Moved prepare_model_for_kbit_training() invocation after obtaining the PEFT model but before disabling use_cache.
Added Verbose Logging:

Included more detailed print statements throughout the script for clearer progress tracking:
Logging Hugging Face login, dataset loading, formatting, model/loading, fine-tuning, and saving.
Enhanced CSV Metrics Logging:

Added timing information to the logged metrics.
Improved the MetricsLogger callback class for detailed epoch, training loss, evaluation loss, and time taken logging.
Plot Training Metrics:

Added a matplotlib plot to visualize training and evaluation loss metrics over epochs and save the plot to the output directory.
Reorganized Imports:

Ensured all necessary imports are at the top of the script for better readability and organization.
Cache Configuration Logging:

Added print statements for setting up Hugging Face cache directories.
Validation and Error Handling:

Included validation for the Hugging Face token and added error handling messages.
Reformatted Dataset Preparation:

Added comments and refined functions for dataset formatting.
Documentation and Comments:

Added detailed comments and log messages to explain key steps and configurations.
Updated Output Paths:
Ensured that all outputs (models, logs, results) are consistently saved to the specified output directory.
Consistency in Tokenizer Setup:
Confirmed the addition of a padding token and updated related log messages.
Updated TrainerCallback:
Refined MetricsLogger class to include timing information for each epoch.
Console Output for Metrics:
Added print statements to output final training metrics to the console at the end of the script for quick review.
These changes should provide a more streamlined, informative, and robust script to handle the fine-tuning process efficiently on an RTX 3060.
